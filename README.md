# FlowVr

Through my solution developers can build VR websites and interactive 360 experiences with the ReactVR framework. Instead of going through the hard process of coding the applications. I build an interface that allows them to drop and drag pictures or video in FBP models that later on â€” can be connected together to build the VR website. These models can continue to be executed as long they have data to work on and an interface to put their output, the applications will generally run in less elapsed time than conventional programs, and make optimal use of all the processors on a machine, with no special programming required to achieve this.
